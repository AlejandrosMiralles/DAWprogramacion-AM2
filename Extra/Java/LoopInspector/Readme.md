You are given a node that is the beginning of a linked list. This list always contains a tail and a loop. Your objective is to determine the length of the loop.

For example in the following picture the tail's size is 3 and the loop size is 12:


// Use the `getNext()` method to get the following node.
node.getNext()
Note: do NOT mutate the nodes!

Thanks to shadchnev, I broke all of the methods from the Hash class.
